i only wrote the code , its for educational purpose to aid you in writing exams and score good in bloody university exams.

if you want to change the code and use it for different application, kindly remove my name then redistribute. as i do not wish to get troubles. any malfunction in code before you modify this is solely my responsibility.

USAGE GUIDE:
Do not change the contents of the folder if you are not a programmer.
page.html contains the markup. you need to manually add it by inspecting 
it in browser and copy the content of <body> tag and paste it in page.html file as google forms wont allow injection.

open page.html so that you will understand why. its the raw content of body tag.
For more instruction see the code. documentation is done in comments.
JUST run the examSolver.py file in CMD or powershell or BASH(linux).


IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
install python 3.x
pip install selenium requests
you need firefox  installed for this thing to work by default as we used gecko driver. 
or download chrome selenium driver and paste it in this folder.
